Each container is a Linux virtual machine. Docker is free open source. The main Docker Web site is <a data-keyref="website-docker" class="xref external" href="https://docker.com">https://docker.com</a>.</p> <p class="p">Docker is fundamentally a Linux-based technology, so even if you are using Docker on Windows or OS X you will need to be familiar with a few basic Linux commands and be comfortable using a command-line shell. You can even use ready-made Docker containers that provide full graphical Unix environments like Ubuntu, accessible through VNC if you want.</p> <p class="p">The Docker platform manages getting, maintaining, and running Docker containers on a host machine. When the host machine is itself a Linux machine the Docker containers can be run directly by the host operating system. When the host machine is Windows or OS X the containers are run by another virtual machine, which serves as the Linux machine that then runs the containers. This approach allows the same container to be run on any operating system but adds a little complexity for Windows and Mac users. But it still makes an easy way to deploy and use software that would otherwise be tedious, difficult, or impossible to run directly under Windows or OS X.</p> <p class="p">The virtual machine that then runs the Docker containers is referred to as the <dfn class="term">Docker machine</dfn>. The default Docker machine uses Oracle's open-source VirtualBox but you can use other virtual machine implementations, such as VMWare. On Windows and OS X you may need to interact directly with the Docker machine in order to access the output of Open Toolkit processes due to complexities with how file permissions work. Docker machines have names, with the name of the default Docker machine being "default". You can get a secure shell for the Docker machine using the command <samp class="ph codeph">docker-machine ssh default</samp>.</p> <p class="p">The Docker platform includes a public container library, the <a data-keyref="website-docker-hub" class="xref external" href="https://hub.docker.com">Docker Hub</a>, which any one can use to make their containers available. When you attempt to run a container for the first time, Docker will automatically try to get it from the Docker Hub for you. This makes deploying and updating software about as easy as it can be. </p> <div class="p">Docker containers can be tagged, usually to reflect specific release versions. In the case of the DITA Open Toolkit containers, the tags are used to reflect the DITA Open Toolkit version used in the container. By default, Docker will look for a container with the tag "latest" but you can specify a tag when running or getting a container. For example, to use the 1.8.5 Open Toolkit you would specify the tag "1.8.5" as part of the <span class="keyword cmdname">docker run</span> command:<pre class="pre codeblock">$ docker run -it <strong class="ph b">ditaot/dita-ot:1.8.5</strong>
root@39245ead9d45:~/DITA-OT# </pre></div> <div class="p">The DITA Open Toolkit Docker image serves two main purposes:<ol class="ol" id="about_docker__ol_vvs_trp_x5"> <li class="li">It provides a working Open Toolkit you can run against your DITA source just as you would any Open Toolkit</li> <li class="li">It provides access ot the Open Toolkit files to other containers, such as continuous integration (CI) servers like Jenkins and GitLab, that want to run the Open Toolkit, and XML processors that need the Open Toolkit-managed entity resolution catalogs (<span class="ph filepath">catalog-dita.xml </span> in the Open Toolkit).</li> </ol></div> <p class="p">Docker containers are defined using configuration files named <span class="ph filepath">Dockerfile</span> (by convention). A given Docker container is always based on another container, either one of the Docker-provided base containers, which provide the base operating system for the container, usually a minimal Linux environment, or a more specialized environment. For example, the DITA Open Toolkit base container is itself based on the "java:8" container, since the Open Toolkit is a Java-based application. By basing one container on another you can quickly build up systems of containers with different configurations with a minimum of duplication. Containers are stored as layered file systems and layers that are the same as shared across containers, making it efficient to have different containers that have only small differences from their base containers.</p> <p class="p">Docker containers can connect to the host operating system or Docker machine by defining <dfn class="term">volumes</dfn>. Volumes are directories within the container that can be connected to host machine or Docker machine directories. Managing volumes and understanding how your local machine's directory structure relates to a given Docker container's volumes is probably the most complicated aspect of using Docker containers.</p> <p class="p">Docker containers are intended to be effemeral, meaning that they can be created and destroyed, started and stopped quickly. As such they do not provide any built-in persistent storage. When a container stops or is removed any changes made within the container are lost. So it is important to understand how to capture anything you want to keep, such as the output of the DITA Open Toolkit. This document tries to describe the processes and practices for doing this on Windows and OS X.</p> <p class="p">To use Docker on Windows and OS X you must install the Docker Toolkit, which provides the various Docker commands and the default VirtualBox Docker engine. You can also install VirtualBox separately if you want (it provides a nice user interface for accessing the virtual machine itself as an alternative to the Docker <span class="keyword cmdname">docker-machine ssh</span> command).</p> <div class="p">Under OS X you may need to manually set up the Docker environment in new terminal windows, or update the Docker environment variables if you restart the Docker machine. You can do this with the command <samp class="ph codeph">eval $(docker-machine env default)</samp>:<pre class="pre codeblock">$ echo $DOCKER_HOST

$ eval $(docker-machine env default)
$ echo $DOCKER_HOST
tcp://192.168.99.100:2376
$ _</pre></div> <p class="p">On Windows you use a Docker-provided Docker Quickstart Terminal, which is a minimal unix-style terminal window preconfigured for Docker use, so you shouldn't need to worry about the environment.</p> <p class="p">You need to know the IP address of the Docker host as that is the IP address you use to connect to servers running in a Docker container under Windows and OS X. This not an issue for the Open Toolkit but is for any Docker container that provides some kind of Web server. For example, you might use an nginx or Apache Tomcat server to serve HTML generated by the Open Toolkit. In that case, you would use the Docker host IP address and the port configured for the server, e.g. "http://192.168.99.100:8080".</p> </div> <footer id="topicsNPLinks"><div id="footer_previous"><a href="../topics/dita-ot-docker-guide.html" class="previous" rel="internal">DITA Open Toolkit Docker Container Guide</a></div><div id="footer_next"><a href="../topics/running_the_open_toolkit.html" class="next" rel="internal">Running The Open Toolkit</a></div></footer></div></section></article><div class="clear"></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div></div><div class="clearfix"></div><div id="footer-container" class="grid_12"></div></div></body></html>
